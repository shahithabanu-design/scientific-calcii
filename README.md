# scientific-calcii
This project implements a real-time scientific calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator offers a user-friendly interface that supports both basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and advanced scientific functions (trigonometry, logarithms, square roots, and exponentiation). The real-time functionality allows the display to update instantly as the user inputs values, providing immediate feedback. Scientific operations like sine, cosine, tangent, square root, and logarithms are supported with shorthand syntax, such as sin(), cos(), log(), and sqrt(), which are internally processed using JavaScript's Math object. The calculator also handles errors gracefully and provides an intuitive experience, including keyboard support for both numbers and operators. The layout is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal usability across both desktop and mobile devices. This tool serves as an efficient, easy-to-use solution for performing both basic and complex mathematical calculations in real time.
